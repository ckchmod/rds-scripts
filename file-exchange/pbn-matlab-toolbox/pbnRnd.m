function [F,varF,cij] = pbnRnd(n,nf,nv)

% [F,varF,cij] = pbnRnd(n,nf,nv) - random BN/PBN
% This function creates a random PBN with n nodes. The number of functions
% per node is defined in nf. Each function may have different number of
% variables, defined in nv. Function returns all the necessary parameters
% (excluding nf and nv), to define an independent PBN.
% INPUT:
% n     - The number of nodes in a random pbn.
% nf    - The number of functions per node. nf is a 1-by-n vector where
%         each element of nf is an integer larger than 0. If nf is a vector
%         of ones, thcen this function generates a random Boolean network.
% nv    - The number of variables in each Boolean function. The length of
%         nv must be equal to the sum of the elements in vector nf. Let cnf
%         be the cumulative sum of the number of functions in the network
%         (starting from the first node), i.e., cnf = cumsum(nf);. Then,
%         the number of variables of the functions for the first node are
%         nv(1:cnf(1)), for the second node nv(cnf(1)+1:cnf(2)), ..., and
%         for the last node nv(cnf(n-1)+1:cnf(n)).
% OUTPUT:
% F     - The functions for the random network. F has size
%         2^max(nv)-by-sum(nf). Truth tables of the functions for the first
%         node are defined in F(:,1:cnf(1)), for the second node
%         F(:,cnf(1)+1:cnf(2)), ..., and for the last node
%         F(:,cnf(n-1)+1:cnf(n)). Since the length of the truth tables may
%         vary between different functions, only the first 2^nv(i) bits are
%         relevant in the i:th column of F. Remaining "unnecessary" bits in
%         each column are set to -1. Let the f = F(;,i) be the i:th
%         function in F, and assume that it is a function of three
%         variables xi, xj, and xk (variables are defined in varF(1:3,i).
%         Then, f(1) defines the output for the input vector (000).
%         Correspondinly, f(2) defines the output for the input vector
%         (001), where xi = xj = 0 and xk = 1, i.e., where the third input
%         variable is equal to one. As another example, f(6) defines the
%         output for the input vector (101), where xi = 1, xj =  0, and
%         xk = 1.
% varF  - The variables of each function. varF is a max(nv)-by-sum(nf)
%         matrix. Variables of the functions for the first node are
%         varF(:,1:cnf(1)), for the second node varF(:,cnf(1)+1:cnf(1)),
%         ..., and for the last node varF(:,cnf(n-1)+1:cnf(n)). Since the
%         number of variables may vary between different functions, only
%         the first nv(i) elements are relevant in the i:th column of varF.
%         Remaining "unnecessary" elements in each column are set to -1.
% cij   - The selection probabilities for the functions. cij is a
%         max(nf)-by-n matrix. The selection probabilities of the functions
%         for the i:th node are cij(:,1:i). Since the number of functions
%         may vary between nodes, only the first nf(i) elements are
%         relevant in the i:th column of cij. Remaining "unnecessary"
%         elements in each column are set to -1.
